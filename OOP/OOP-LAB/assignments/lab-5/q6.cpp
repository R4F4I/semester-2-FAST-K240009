/*

? |Say hello to your new financial sidekick, LoanHelper—the class that will kindly remind you how
much you're paying every month for that loan you may or may not regret. It has a special variable
to store the interest rate as a user defined constant value (but don’t go wild, it’s between 0% and
0.5%—just enough to make you feel slightly guilty). You’ll give it your loan amount and the
number of months you’re willing to spend thinking about your life choices. The process is simple:
divide the loan by the months, add a sprinkle of interest, and boom! It’ll spit out something like,
‘You have to pay 999 every month for 12 months to repay your loan.’ No more confusion—just
pure, financial reality!""
