You're designing a library system in C++, 
but this isn't just any boring old databaseâ€”this is where books come to life (well, sort of). 

- First, you need a Book class because, let's be honest, a library without books is just a fancy warehouse. 
    - This class will hold the VIP details: title, author, and publisherâ€”the holy trinity of bookish existence. 
    - Of course, like any respectable book, it needs a constructor to bring it into the world and a display function to proudly announce, "Hey, look at me! I exist!" 

But hold onto your bookmarks, because here comes the real page-turner! 

- You need a FictionBook class that inherits from Bookâ€”because let's face it, fiction books are the fun ones!
    - This subclass adds genre (so we know if it's a thrilling mystery or a sappy romance) and protagonist (because every story needs a heroâ€”or an anti-hero if you're feeling dramatic). 
    - This class will also have a constructor to set everything up and a display function to spill all the juicy details. 


Finally, in the main function, you'll create an object of FictionBook and display its details, because what's
the point of writing code if you can't flex it? 

So, grab your imaginary reading glasses, and let's turn this coding project into a bestseller! ðŸ“–ðŸ’»âœ¨
