/*

You're about to craft the greatest game world ever (or at least one that compiles). 
It all starts with the legendary: 
- Character class‚Äîthe grand ancestor of all fighters, with two crucial stats: 
    - health (so they don't collapse after a light breeze) and 
    - damage (because tickling enemies doesn't win battles).
- Of course, this class needs a constructor to give life to these brave souls and a display function so they can proudly show off their stats like RPG influencers. 

But what's a game without good guys and bad guys? 

- Enter the Enemy and Player classes, both inheriting from Character. 
    - The Enemy exists solely to make players rage-quit, 
    - while the Player is the hero who either saves the world or just hoards loot for hours. 
- Both get their own constructors and display functions‚Äîbecause villains and heroes alike deserve their moment in the spotlight. 

Now, hold onto your enchanted capes because here comes the real magic‚Äî
- The Wizard! 
    - This arcane warrior inherits from Player but also wields magic power and spells, because swinging a sword is way too basic. 
    - Naturally, it gets a constructor to infuse it with all the mystical goodness, 
    - plus a display function so it can flex its sorcery like a true magical influencer. 

Finally, in your main function, you'll 
- summon a Wizard object and 
- display its stats, 

because if you're writing all this code and not showing off the results, did the magic even happen? 
So, grab your coding wand, chant `std::cout,` and let's conjure up some legendary C++ wizardry! ‚ú®üî•üßô‚ôÇÔ∏è
