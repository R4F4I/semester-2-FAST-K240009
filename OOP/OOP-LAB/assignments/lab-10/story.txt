A thirsty crow found a pitcher with a little water at the bottom. However, the neck of the pitcher was too narrow, and the water was out of reach. The crow thought hard and came up with an idea.

It began picking up small pebbles and dropping them into the pitcher one by one. Slowly, the water level rose until it was high enough for the crow to drink. The crow quenched its thirst and flew away, satisfied.

The moral of the story is: "Necessity is the mother of invention."
