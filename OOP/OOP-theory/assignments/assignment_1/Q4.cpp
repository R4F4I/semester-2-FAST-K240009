FAST's transportation system currently has a troublesome process for student registration,
semester payments, and to verify it manually on points. They want you to automate the entire
process to streamline the system.
The system should
- Allow students to register for the transportation service.
- Enable students to pay semester fees to keep their transportation cards active.
- Manage routes, including pick-up and drop-off stops for students.
- Record attendance automatically when students tap their cards on the bus.
- Manage bus routes with stops and assign students to appropriate stops.

Identify the required classes, their data members, and member functions. Then, create a class
diagram to represent the system. Based on your class diagram, write a C++ program to
implement the system.
You must follow all the OOP rules learned up to the 5th week. This means using proper getters
and setters, constructors, destructors, and making use of constant and static variables where
needed.
